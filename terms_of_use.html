              referred to in this Privacy Policy
              as "Lorem Ipsum", "us", "our" or "we", we have provided this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect,
              use, share and protect
              information about the users of our Website (hereafter referred to as “user”, “you” or "your"). For the
              purposes of this Agreement, any
              use of the terms "Lorem Ipsum", "us", "our" or "we" includes Wasai LLC, without limitation. We will not
              use or share your personal

              about the types of personal
              data we collect, the purposes for which we use the data, the ways in which the data is handled and your
              rights with regard to your
              personal data. Furthermore, this Privacy Policy is intended to satisfy the obligation of transparency

              changes will go into effect on the "Last updated" date shown at the end of this Privacy Policy. By
              continuing to use the Site or
              Services, you consent to the revised Privacy Policy. We encourage you to periodically review the Privacy

              We also automatically collect information via the Website through the use of various technologies,
              including, but not limited to
              Cookies and Web Beacons (explained below). We may collect your IP address, browsing behavior and device

            <span>
              INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM OTHER SOURCESWe may also receive information from other sources and combine
              that with information we

              account with a social media
              service, e.g. LinkedIn, Facebook or Twitter, or if you engage with a separate App or Website that uses our
              API, or whose API we use,
              we may receive information about you or your connections from that Site or App. This includes, without

              information, profile picture, gender, user name, user ID associated with your social media account, age
              range, language, country,

            <span>
              INFORMATION THIRD PARTIES PROVIDEWe may collect information about you from sources other than you, such as
              from social media websites
              (i.e., Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter or others), blogs, analytics providers, business affiliates and
              partners and other users. This
              includes, without limitation, identity data, contact data, marketing and communications data, behavioral

              AGGREGATED DATAWe may collect, use and share Aggregated Data such as statistical or demographic data for
              any purpose. Aggregated Data
              is de-identified or anonymized and does not constitute Personal Data for the purposes of the GDPR as this
              data does not directly or
              indirectly reveal your identity. If we ever combine Aggregated Data with your Personal Data so that it can
              directly or indirectly
              identify you, we treat the combined data as PII which will only be used in accordance with this Privacy

              <li>
                When you visit our Services, we may send one or more Cookies – small data files – to your computer to
                uniquely identify your browser
                and let us help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Sites. “Cookies” are text-only
                pieces of information that
                a website transfers to an individual’s hard drive or other website browsing equipment for record keeping
                purposes. A Cookie may
                convey anonymous information about how you browse the Services to us so we can provide you with a more
                personalized experience, but
                does not collect personal information about you. Cookies allow the Sites to remember important
                information that will make your use
                of the site more convenient. A Cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the
                Cookie has come, the “lifetime”
                of the Cookie, and a randomly generated unique number or other value. Certain Cookies may be used on the
                Sites regardless of whether
                you are logged in to your account or not.
              </li>
              <li>Session Cookies are temporary Cookies that remain in the Cookie file of your browser until you leave
                the Site.</li>
              <li>
                Persistent Cookies remain in the Cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will
                depend on the lifetime of the
                specific Cookie).
              </li>
              <li>
                When we use session Cookies to track the total number of visitors to our Site, this is done on an
                anonymous aggregate basis (as
                Cookies do not in themselves carry any personal data).
